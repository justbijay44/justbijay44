👋 Hi, I’m Bijay Syangtan.

🤖 I’m fascinated by Machine Learning and Deep Learning, especially neural networks like RNNs and CNNs, and how they are inspired by the human brain.

🐱 I love learning stories behind AI, like how a cat image helped create CNNs, and how tools like LangChain make chatbots possible using LLMs.

💡 ML/DL is a field where you keep forgetting things and rediscovering them — and that’s what keeps it exciting.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that are fun and interesting.
